Ransomware Attack Simulation & Prevention

A web-based simulation of a ransomware attack and prevention mechanism.

Features
- Simulates a ransomware attack by encrypting files
- Provides a prevention mechanism by simulating a backup and restore process
- Demonstrates the importance of regular backups and robust security measures

Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/ransomware-simulation.git`
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. Click the "Simulate Ransomware Attack" button to simulate an attack
4. Click the "Prevent Ransomware Attack" button to prevent the attack and restore files

How it Works
1. *Ransomware Attack Simulation*: The simulation encrypts files by adding a visual indicator to each file.
2. *Prevention Mechanism*: The prevention mechanism simulates a backup and restore process by removing the encryption indicator from each file.

Limitations
- This is a highly simplified simulation and should not be used in production environments.
- Real-world ransomware attacks are much more complex and require robust security measures.

Future Development
- Improve the simulation to mimic real-world ransomware attacks more closely
- Add additional prevention mechanisms, such as anti-virus software and firewalls
- Enhance the user interface to provide a more realistic experience
